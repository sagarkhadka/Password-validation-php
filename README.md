Hello ðŸ‘‹,
If you are a student and have assignment to validate the password for the user then you can use this repo. But please fork the project and if you find any errors or issue feel free to report so that other students can also get the benefit. I am also a student and I will help you if I can solve the problem.

The project is done in php and mysql so run the site we require xampp or simillar program that can create localhost server.
You can download xampp for windows their official website https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

So first install xampp and follow the instruction
----------
step 1: Locate htdocs folder inside of xampp folder from the installed directory. Mostly it is located in C:\xampp\htdocs

step 2: Make a folder inside htdocs for example:- "login" and paste all the source file.

step 3: Run XAMPP control panel and start Apache and MySQL

step 4: Open any browser and type localhost/phpmyadmin. Click on import and select database.sql from the project source file and click go. Without importing sql file we cannot login or signup.

step 4: Open new tab and type localhost/foldername. --> In folder name type the name of folder that we created in step 2. "localhost/login"

This will open the index.php and from there we can signup and login.
